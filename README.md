Haven Of Hope-

A number of children need a safe place to live their lives, and a number of couples need children in their homes because they can provide for them and can look after them without expecting any monetary gain,  our project deals with this process. It basically finds children who are abandoned and provides them with Foster Parents.
Our project- Haven of Hope looks at this as an opportunity to build a network and solve a problem. It deals with defining a network and creating Enterprises that depend on each other to collaborate and make greater good for societal benefit. 

We can create a network in this project.

There are 4 enterprises involved in this network.

1) Bank Enterprise comprises the Bank Manager.

2) Hospital Enterprise comprises the Doctor and Lab.

3) Foundation Enterprise comprises the Legal and Management.

4) State Government Enterprise comprises the Child Safety Department and Police Department.

There are 8 roles in this 

Admin- 
	Deals with maintaining the particular enterprise it is related to.

System Admin
	Deals with maintaining the entire network. 

Bank Manager
	Deals with the Donations provided and the Organizations that receive these donations.

Doctor
	Is in touch with the Child Safety Department and the Lab assistants. 

Lab Assistant 
	In the case of the Test Report requirement from the Doctor, performs necessary tests and sends it back to Doctor.

Investigator 
	Makes sure everything is legal and verifies the Child's details.

	Takes part in handing over the child to the Foster Parent. Makes sure everything is legal and authenticated.

WorkFlow of the Project.

1) The Child Safety Department which comes under the State Government Enterprise reports a missing/abandoned child. 
2) They make a note of the Childs's basic details and ask for a Doctors opinion on the health of the child.
3) The Doctor who comes under the Hospital Department takes a look at the details provided by the Child Safety Department and then decides if a medical examination is required or not. 
4) Let us say, it is required, then the Doctor requests the medical examinations to be done by the Lab Assistants. 
5) The Lab Assistant does the medical examination asked by the doctor and sends the report back to the Doctor. 
6) The Doctor then forwards these examination results to the Child Safety Department. 
7) The Investigator who comes under the State Government, verifies these details and then puts the child in the adoption catalog.
8) In the meantime, the Management, which comes under the Foundation Enterprise, runs a background check on suitable and available Foster Parents. Their details are saved. 
9) The Management is also in touch with the Bank Manager who is a part of the Bank Enterprise, he oversees the donations. He accepts the donations made to the particular organization and approves them, and also oversees the credibility of the foster parent.
10) The Legal Department in the Foundation takes care of the legalities involved throughout. it makes sure that the entire process across the network is legal.

And finally, every child finds a home.
